# fashion-tryon

Anyone can now be a fashion model and walk the runway!

## How it works

1. Start by uploading an image of yourself (or a friend)
2. Once you upload the image, the app will find 10 high fashion outfits that suit you well.
3. Select the outfits you like, then click "Start Show"
4. This will generate a video of you in those outfits walking the runway
5. After, if you're interested, our web agent will find similar outfits online you can buy!
